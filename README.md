Active Appearance Models for People Recognition (Master Thesis)

Active Appearance Models (AAMs) is a computer vision procedure for statistical matching of object shape and appearance between images. 
The present work will analyze how AAMs can be employed with RGB-Depth technology, so robots endowing a Kinect sensor can perceive and recognize humans more effectively in order to unequivocally
identify them. This research is associated to the RoCKIn@Home challenge, an initiative from the European RoCKIn project focusing on domestic service robots.
